TO DO: (in order of importance)
. click icons to view messages
. voting on messages changes the database
. decide on colour scheme
. nail icon

(stretches)
. upvote messages to change size (I'm thinking maybe just one size larger? maybe a ratio: if 50% or more votes on a comment are up, the icon is big. otherwise, it's small)
. increase/decrease radius
. unseen icons bounce/glow
. add photos + drawings to messages
. messages are shown on the map screen itself


TO DONE:
. app flow (going between fragments)
. loading location services
. set up online database
. add messages to database (text + location)
. messages automatically deleting
. google maps displaying in map fragment
. radius drawn on map
. view message icons on map
. font changed
